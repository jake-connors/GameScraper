App Description
---------------

iOS app built using apple’s XCODE software application. Code is written Swift programming language and also contains with html taken from webpages. It's an app that can web scrape several websites and it shows specific data onto the iPhone screen.

The app’s target group of users is people who play video games. Statistics are really important in competitive video games, so my app aims to provide stats that are available online from third party websites. One could use the web to get these stats themselves, but my app provides a very efficient interface. The user receives a way to see not only important information, but from multiple sources as well.

Basically, a user chooses the game they play from the Home Screen, they input their username for the game into the app and are then prompted to choose a website from a list of available options. Once they choose a website, the app will display detailed information and it filters out unnecessary statistics.

So the app gives the user convenience as they will see only the useful information, and can quickly jump to another website’s data. Currently the app has functionality for three different games, each having 2 or 3 websites to choose from.
